      "abstract": "Abstract:  A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is presented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark, gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious selection of events.",

Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have received increased attention in recent years.

We also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the(k,`)-pebble game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between pebble game algorithms and previous sparse graph algorithms by Gabow [5], Gabow and Westermann [6] and Hendrickson [9]. 1. Introduction and preliminaries The focus of this paper is decompositions of(k,`)-sparse graphs into edge-disjoint subgraphs that certify sparsity. We usegraphto mean a multigraph, possibly with loops. We say that a graph is(k,`)-sparseif no subset ofn ′ vertices spans more thankn ′ −`edges in the graph; a (k,`)-sparse graph withkn ′ −`edges is(k,`)-tight. We call the rangek≤`≤2k−1 the upper range of sparse graphs and 0≤`≤kthe lower range. In this paper, we present efficient algorithms for finding decompositions that certify sparsity in the upper range of`. Our algorithms also apply in the lower range, which was already ad- dressed by [3, 4, 5, 6, 19]. A decomposition certifies the sparsity of a graph if the sparse graphs and graphs admitting the decomposition coincide. Our algorithms are based on a new characterization of sparse graphs, which we call the pebble game with colors. The pebble game with colors is a simple graph construction rule that produces a sparse graph along with a sparsity-certifying decomposition. We define and study a canonical class of pebble game constructions, which correspond to previously studied decompositions of sparse graphs into edge disjoint trees. Our results provide a unifying framework for all the previously known special cases, including Nash-Williams- Tutte and [7, 24]. Indeed, in the lower range, canonical pebble game constructions capture the properties of the augmenting paths used in matroid union and intersection algorithms[5, 6]. Since the sparse graphs in the upper range are not known to be unions or intersections of the matroids for which there are efficient augmenting path algorithms, these do not easily apply in ∗ Research of both authors funded by the NSF under grants NSF CCF-0430990 and NSF-DARPA CARGO CCR-0310661 to the first author. arXiv:0704.0002v2 [math.CO] 13 Dec 2008 2Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran TermMeaning Sparse graphGEvery non-empty subgraph onn ′ vertices has≤kn ′ −`edges Tight graphGG= (V,E)is sparse and | V | =n, | E | =kn−` BlockHinGGis sparse, andHis a tight subgraph ComponentHofGGis sparse andHis a maximal block Map-graphGraph that admits an out-degree-exactly-one orientation (k,`)-maps-and-treesEdge-disjoint union of`trees and(k−`)map-grpahs `TkUnion of`trees, each vertex is in exactlykof them Set of tree-pieces of an`Tkinduced onV ′ ⊂VPieces of trees in the`Tkspanned byE(V ′ ) Proper`TkEveryV ′ ⊂Vcontains≥`pieces of trees from the`Tk Table 1.Sparse graph and decomposition terminology used in this paper. the upper range. Pebble game with colors constructions may thus be considered a strengthening of augmenting paths to the upper range of matroidal sparse graphs. 1.1. Sparse graphs A graph is(k,`)-sparseif for any non-empty subgraph withm ′ edges andn ′ vertices,m ′ ≤ kn ′ −`.We observe that this condition implies that 0≤`≤2k−1, and from now on in this paper we will make this assumption. A sparse graph that hasnvertices and exactlykn−`edges is calledtight. For a graphG= (V,E), andV ′ ⊂V, we use the notation span(V ′ )for the number of edges in the subgraph induced byV ′ . In a directed graph, out(V ′ )is the number of edges with the tail inV ′ and the head inV−V ′ ; for a subgraph induced byV ′ , we call such an edge anout-edge. There are two important types of subgraphs of sparse graphs. Ablockis a tight subgraph of a sparse graph. Acomponentis a maximal block. Table 1 summarizes the sparse graph terminology used in this paper. 1.2. Sparsity-certifying decompositions Ak-arborescence is a graph that admits a decomposition intokedge-disjoint spanning trees. Figure 1(a) shows an example of a 3-arborescence. Thek-arborescent graphs are described by the well-known theorems of Tutte [23] and Nash-Williams [17] as exactly the(k,k)-tight graphs. Amap-graphis a graph that admits an orientation such that the out-degree of each vertex is exactly one. Ak-map-graphis a graph that admits a decomposition intokedge-disjoint map- graphs. Figure 1(b) shows an example of a 2-map-graphs; the edges are oriented in one possible configuration certifying that each color forms a map-graph. Map-graphs may be equivalently defined (see, e.g., [18]) as having exactly one cycle per connected component. 1 A(k,`)-maps-and-treesis a graph that admits a decomposition intok−`edge-disjoint map-graphs and`spanning trees. Another characterization of map-graphs, which we will use extensively in this paper, is as the(1,0)-tight graphs [8, 24]. Thek-map-graphs are evidently(k,0)-tight, and [8, 24] show that the converse holds as well. 1 Our terminology follows Lov ́ asz in [16]. In the matroid literature map-graphs are sometimes known as bases of the bicycle matroid or spanning pseudoforests.

Abstract The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field fluid model with a non-Newtonian approach proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5 billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche’s limit. The result suggests that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 × 10 -22 s -1 m -1 . This model predicts that the Mars’s rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate about -4.38 × 10 -22 rad s -2 . Key Words. dark matter, fluid, evolution, Earth, Moon, Mars 1 1. Introduction The popularly accepted theory for the formation of the Earth-Moon system is that the Moon was formed from debris of a strong impact by a giant planetesimal with the Earth at the close of the planet-forming period (Hartmann and Davis 1975). Since the formation of the Earth-Moon system, it has been evolving at all time scale. It is well known that the Moon is receding from us and both the Earth’s rotation and Moon’s rotation are slowing. The popular theory is that the tidal friction causes all those changes based on the conservation of the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system. The situation becomes complicated in describing the past evolution of the Earth-Moon system. Because the Moon is moving away from us and the Earth rotation is slowing, this means that the Moon was closer and the Earth rotation was faster in the past. Creationists argue that based on the tidal friction theory, the tidal friction should be stronger and the recessional rate of the Moon should be greater in the past, the distance of the Moon would quickly fall inside the Roche's limit (for earth, 15500 km) in which the Moon would be torn apart by gravity in 1 to 2 billion years ago. However, geological evidence indicates that the recession of the Moon in the past was slower than the present rate, i. e., the recession has been accelerating with time. Therefore, it must be concluded that tidal friction was very much less in the remote past than we would deduce on the basis of present-day observations (Stacey 1977). This was called “geological time scale difficulty” or “Lunar crisis” and is one of the main arguments by creationists against the tidal friction theory (Brush 1983). But we have to consider the case carefully in various aspects. One possible scenario is that the Earth has been undergoing dynamic evolution at all time scale since 2 its inception, the geological and physical conditions (such as the continent positions and drifting, the crust, surface temperature fluctuation like the glacial/snowball effect, etc) at remote past could be substantially different from currently, in which the tidal friction could be much less; therefore, the receding rate of the Moon could be slower. Various tidal friction models were proposed in the past to describe the evolution of the Earth- Moon system to avoid such difficulty or crisis and put the Moon at quite a comfortable distance from Earth at 4.5 billion years ago (Hansen 1982, Kagan and Maslova 1994, Ray et al. 1999, Finch 1981, Slichter 1963). The tidal friction theories explain that the present rate of tidal dissipation is anomalously high because the tidal force is close to a resonance in the response function of ocean (Brush 1983). Kagan gave a detailed review about those tidal friction models (Kagan 1997). Those models are based on many assumptions about geological (continental position and drifting) and physical conditions in the past, and many parameters (such as phase lag angle, multi-mode approximation with time dependent frequencies of the resonance modes, etc.) have to be introduced and carefully adjusted to make their predictions close to the geological evidence. However, those assumptions and parameters are still challenged, to certain extent, as concoction. The second possible scenario is that another mechanism could dominate the evolution of the Earth-Moon system and the role of the tidal friction is not significant. In the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society, University of California at Riverside, the author proposed a dark matter field fluid model (Pan 2005) with a non-Newtonian approach, the current Moon and Earth data agree with this model very well. This paper will demonstrate that the past evolution of Moon-Earth system can be described by the dark matter field fluid model without any assumptions 3 about past geological and physical conditions. Although the subject of the evolution of the Earth-Moon system has been extensively studied analytically or numerically, to the author’s knowledge, there are no theories similar or equivalent to this model. 2. Invisible matter In modern cosmology, it was proposed that the visible matter in the universe is about 2 ~ 10 % of the total matter and about 90 ~ 98% of total matter is currently invisible which is called dark matter and dark energy, such invisible matter has an anti- gravity property to make the universe expanding faster and faster. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, the evolution of the universe should be dominated by the physical mechanism of such invisible matter, such physical mechanism could be far beyond the current Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics, and the Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics could reflect only a corner of the iceberg of the greater physics.

The proof involves a bijection from these automata to certain marked lattice paths and a sign-reversing involution to evaluate the deter- minant. 1 IntroductionThe chief purpose of this paper is to show bijectively that a determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic single-source automata. Specifically, letA k (n) denote thekn×knmatrix with (i, j) entry \u0002 ⌊ i−1 k ⌋+2 ⌊ i−1 k ⌋+1+i−j \u0003 , where \u0002 i j \u0003 is the Stirling cycle number, the number of permutations on [i] withjcycles. For example, A 2 (5) =                       1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 11 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 11 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 10 35 50 24 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 10 35 50 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 15 85 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 15                       . 1 As evident in the example,A k (n) is formed fromkcopies of each of rows 2 throughn+ 1 of the Stirling cycle triangle, arranged so that the first nonzero entry in each row is a 1 and, after the first row, this 1 occurs just before the main diagonal; in other words,A k (n) is a Hessenberg matrix with 1s on the infra-diagonal. We will show Main Theorem.The determinant ofA k (n)is the number of unlabeled acyclic single- source automata withntransient states on a(k+ 1)-letter input alphabet. Section 2 reviews basic terminology for automata and recurrence relations to count finite acyclic automata. Section 3 introduces column-marked subdiagonal paths, which play an intermediate role, and a way to code them. Section 4 presents a bijection from these column-marked subdiagonal paths to unlabeled acyclic single-source automata. Fi- nally, Section 5 evaluates detA k (n) using a sign-reversing involution and shows that the determinant counts the codes for column-marked subdiagonal paths. 2 Automata A (complete, deterministic) automaton consists of a set of statesand an input alphabet whose letters transform the states among themselves: a letter and a state produce another state (possibly the same one). A finite automaton (finite set of states, finite input alphabet of, say,kletters) can be represented as ak-regular directed multigraph with ordered edges: the vertices represent the states and the first, second, . . . edge from a vertex give the effect of the first, second, . . . alphabet letter on that state. A finite automaton cannot be acyclic in the usual sense of no cycles: pick a vertex and follow any path from it. This path must ultimately hit a previously encountered vertex, thereby creating acycle. So the term acyclic is used in the looser sense that only one vertex, called thesink, is involved in cycles. This means that all edges from the sink loop back to itself (and may safely be omitted) and all other paths feed into the sink. A non-sink state is calledtransient. Thesizeof an acyclic automaton is the number of transient states. An acyclic automaton of sizenthus has transient states which we label 1,2, . . . , nand a sink, labeledn+ 1. Liskovets [ 1] uses the inclusion-exclusion principle (more about this below) to obtain the following recurrence relation for the numbera k (n) 2 of acyclic automata of sizenon ak-letter input alphabet (k≥1): a k (0) = 1;a k (n) = n−1 X j=0 (−1) n−j−1 \u0012 n j \u0013 (j+ 1) k(n−j) a k (j), n≥1. Asourceis a vertex with no incoming edges. A finite acyclic automaton has at least one source because a path traversed backwardv 1 ←v 2 ←v 3 ←. . .must have distinct vertices and so cannot continue indefinitely. An automaton issingle-source(or initially connected) if it has only one source. LetB k (n) denote the set of single-source acyclic finite (SAF) automata on ak-letter input alphabet with vertices 1,2, . . . , n+ 1 where 1 is the source andn+ 1 is the sink, and setb k (n) =|B k (n)|. Thetwo-line representation of an automaton inB k (n) is the 2×knmatrix whose columns list the edges in order. For example, B= 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 5 2 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 5 3 2 2 6 ! is inB 3 (5) and the source-to-sink paths inBinclude 1 a →2 a →6,1 b →4 c →3 a →6,1 b → 4 b →5 b →2 b →6, where the alphabet is{a, b, c}. Proposition 1.The numberb k (n)of SAF automata of sizenon ak-letter input alphabet (n, k≥1)is given by b k (n) = n X i=1 (−1) n−i \u0012 n−1 i−1 \u0013 (i+ 1) k(n−i) a k (i) RemarkThis formula is a bit more succinct than the the recurrence in [ 1, Theorem 3.2]. ProofConsider the setAof acyclic automata with transient vertices [n] ={1,2, . . . , n} in which 1 is a source. Call 2,3, . . . , ntheinteriorvertices. ForX⊆[2, n], let f(X) = # automata inAwhose set of interior vertices includesX, g(X) = # automata inAwhose set of interior vertices is preciselyX.

This result is a consequence of the description of the Hardy spacesH p (R N ) in terms of dyadic and special atoms. Recently, several novel methods for computing the BMO norm of afunction fin two dimensions were discussed in [9]. Given its importance, it is also of interest to explore the possibility of computing the norm of a BMO function, or more generally a function in the Lipschitz class Λ α , using the dyadic grid inR N . It turns out that the BMO question is closely related to that of approximating functions in the Hardy spaceH 1 (R N ) by the Haar system. The approximation inH 1 (R N ) by affine systems was proved in [2], but this result does not apply to the Haar system. Now, ifH A (R) denotes the closure of the Haar system inH 1 (R), it is not hard to see that the distanced(f, H A ) off∈H 1 (R) toH A is∼ ∣ ∣ ∫ ∞ 0 f(x)dx ∣ ∣ , see [1]. Thus, neither dyadic atoms suffice to describe the Hardy spaces, nor the evaluation of the norm in BMO can be reduced to a straightforward computation using the dyadicintervals. In this paper we address both of these issues. First, we give a characterization of the Hardy spacesH p (R N ) in terms of dyadic and special atoms, and then, by a duality argument, we show how to compute the norm in Λ α (R N ),α≥0, using the dyadic grid. We begin by introducing some notations. LetJdenote a family of cubes QinR N , andP d the collection of polynomials inR N of degree less than or equal tod. Givenα≥0,Q∈J, and a locally integrable functiong, letp Q (g) denote the unique polynomial inP [α] such that [g−p Q (g)]χ Q has vanishing moments up to order [α]. For a locally square-integrable functiong, we consider the maximal function M ♯,2 α,J g(x) given by M ♯,2 α,J g(x) = sup x∈Q, Q∈J 1 |Q| α/N ( 1 |Q| ∫ Q |g(y)−p Q (g)(y)| 2 dy ) 1/2 . 1991Mathematics Subject Classification.42B30,42B35. 1 2WAEL ABU-SHAMMALA AND ALBERTO TORCHINSKY The Lipschitz space Λ α,J consists of those functionsgsuch thatM ♯,2 α,J gis inL ∞ ,kgk Λ α,J =kM ♯,2 α,J gk ∞ ; when the family in question contains all cubes inR N , we simply omit the subscriptJ. Of course, Λ 0 = BMO. Two other families, of dyadic nature, are of interest to us. Intervals inRof the formI n,k = [ (k−1)2 n , k2 n ], wherekandnare arbitrary integers, positive, negative or 0, are said to be dyadic. InR N , cubes which are the product of dyadic intervals of the same length, i.e., of the formQ n,k =I n,k 1 ×···×I n,k N , are called dyadic, and the collection of all such cubes is denotedD. There is also the familyD 0 . LetI ′ n,k = [(k−1)2 n ,(k+ 1)2 n ], wherekand nare arbitrary integers. ClearlyI ′ n,k is dyadic ifkis odd, but not ifkis even. Now, the collection{I ′ n,k :n, kintegers}contains all dyadic intervals as well as the shifts [(k−1)2 n + 2 n−1 , k2 n + 2 n−1 ] of the dyadic intervals by their half length. InR N , putD 0 ={Q ′ n,k :Q ′ n,k =I ′ n,k 1 ×···×I ′ n,k N };Q ′ n,k is called a special cube. Note thatD 0 containsDproperly. Finally, givenI ′ n,k , letI ′ L n,k = [(k−1)2 n , k2 n ], andI ′ R n,k = [k2 n ,(k+ 1)2 n ]. The 2 N subcubes ofQ ′ n,k =I ′ n,k 1 ×···×I ′ n,k N of the formI ′ S 1 n,k 1 ×···×I ′ S N n,k N , S j =LorR, 1≤j≤N, are called the dyadic subcubes ofQ ′ n,k . LetQ 0 denote the special cube [−1,1] N . Givenα≥0, we construct a familyS α of piecewise polynomial splines inL 2 (Q 0 ) that will be useful in characterizing Λ α . LetAbe the subspace ofL 2 (Q 0 ) consisting of all functions with vanishing moments up to order [α] which coincide with a polynomial inP [α] on each of the 2 N dyadic subcubes ofQ 0 .Ais a finite dimensional subspace ofL 2 (Q 0 ), and, therefore, by the Graham-Schmidt orthogonalization process, say,Ahas an orthonormal basis inL 2 (Q 0 ) consisting of functions p 1 , . . . , p M with vanishing moments up to order [α], which coincide with a polynomial inP [α] on each dyadic subinterval ofQ 0 . Together with eachp L we also consider all dyadic dilations and integer translations given by p L n,k,α (x) = 2 n(N+α) p L (2 n x 1 +k 1 , . . . ,2 n x N +k N ),1≤L≤M , and let S α ={p L n,k,α :n, kintegers,1≤L≤M}. Our first result shows how the dyadic grid can be used to compute the norm in Λ α . Theorem A.Letgbe a locally square-integrable function andα≥0. Then, g∈Λ α if, and only if,g∈Λ α,D andA α (g) = sup p∈S α ∣ ∣ hg, pi ∣ ∣ <∞. Moreover, kgk Λ α ∼kgk Λ α,D +A α (g). Furthermore, it is also true, and the proof is given in Proposition 2.1 be- low, thatkgk Λ α ∼ kgk Λ α,D 0 . However, in this simpler formulation, the tree structure of the cubes inDhas been lost. FROM DYADIC Λ α TO Λ α 3 The proof of Theorem A relies on a close investigation of the predualof Λ α , namely, the Hardy spaceH p (R N ) with 0< p= (α+N)/N≤1. In the process we characterizeH p in"
